Summary
-------

[Microsoft Photo Story 3](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11132) creates slideshows using digital photos.  [Ken Burns Effects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Burns_effect), audio, and text are added to produce a WMV that can be viewed on Windows and mobile devices.

[Vernacular Media Services](https://www.jaars.org/what/media) (VMS) has used this to create Bible stories in many languages and has templates in [wp3 file format](http://file.org/extension/wp3).

This format was considered binary until it was discovered that it is actually a [Cabinet file format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_%28file_format%29), an archive file format for Windows.

This project takes a wp3 format file created by VMS for Bible stories and generates the files to be used in Scripture App Builder which support a Bible story format using [USFM](http://paratext.org/about/usfm).
